# Octopress success
I'm pleased I was able to sort out the Git problem preventing me from bringing up Octopress. The problem was that I'd used the default process for creating a Git Pages site, which creates a repository and adds a license and README file. The addition of the files meant that that repository was out of sync with the _deploy folder in Octopress. Going to the _deploy folder and doing a git pull brought down the two files, and with everything in sync! the deploy worked.

My next step in learning Git is to grok how to effectively use a cloned repository. I am now using both slogger and Octopress and have local repositories for both. I figure as long as I don't do a push I won't mess up the masters. The question is how have my own remote repository for these - more learning is needed.
